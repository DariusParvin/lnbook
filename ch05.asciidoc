== Set up your Lightning Network Node
The Lightning Network is specified in the lightning-rfc by the open source community.
The lightning-rfc is also called Basics of Lightning Technology (BOLT) which is a collection of documents (BOLTs) that specify the components needed for the protocol.
There are several teams who implement the BOLTs as software which you can run on your computer or a server.
All those teams also contribute to the BOLTs.
In this chapter you will learn how to set up each of the software packages for each of the Lightning Network implementations.
We presented them in alphabetical order to emphasize that we generally do not prefer or recommend one over the other.
It will depend on your preferences which of the software packages you might want to work with.
